# Changelog for Ferium

## `v3.22.0`
### 24.04.2022

- Update to Libium 1.9
- Added static variables for a yellow tick and the dialoguer colourful theme
- Extracted the pick mod loader code to `profile/mod.rs`
- Added a yellow tick if the mod was compatible due to backwards compatibility

## [3.21.0] - 20.04.2022

- Removed `no_patch_check` flag for the upgrade command
- There are now overrides for game version and mod loader checks. For now there is no UI, you have to edit the config file manually

## [3.20.1] - 16.04.2022

When picking a file from a version, Ferium will get the primary file rather than the first file

## [3.20.0] - 16.04.2022

- Added a `Downloadable` struct that represents (and be converted from) a mod file from Modrinth, GitHub Releases, or CurseForge
- There is now also a constant for the cross too ("Ã—")
- Big changes to upgrading:
  - Does not empty the output directory
  - Checks if the latest compatible version is already downloaded, if so it does not download it again
  - If there are files that are not the latest compatible version of a mod, then they are deleted. So _effectively_ the output directory is emptied

## [3.19.1] - 03.04.2022

- Added a sort command that sorts mods in alphabetical order
- Edited the `mod.rs` files to make accessing functions better
- Updated some user facing output such as command help pages, and errors
- Reverted to the old output style in the add command

## [3.19.0] - 02.04.2022

- Added back the verbose flag to the list command. The verbose version is the same as before, and the non-verbose version lists out all mod names only
- Small edits to the add command to support the new config format
- The list command now uses a more concise method to display lists of developers/categories (hence the new dependency `itertools`)
- Many commands have been converted to work on one project at a time so there are less loops in functions and more in main.rs
- The remove command has been significantly improved and is now much faster due to the new name storing format
- The remove command now also requires argument provided names to be exactly the same
- Simplified delete profile command

## [3.14.0] - 06.03.2022

  - `json.rs`
  - `launchermeta.rs`
  - `wrappers.rs`
  - `src/util`
- Moved `util/cli.rs` and `util/ferium_error.rs` to `src/cli.rs` and `src/error.rs`
- Changed errors to the more typical style, `Error` and  `Result` in a `src/error.rs`
- Removed `InvalidDeviceError`, libium just panics instead as it should've never been compiled on an incompatible platform
- Move the `Profile::create_ui()` function to the `main.rs` file
- Upgrade to Ferinth v2
- Add `clean` target to makefile
- Add `URLParseError` from Ferinth
- Switch to an asynchronous std using tokio
- Removed verbose flag for list

## [3.11.1] - 28.01.2022

Windows MSVC support!

- The makefile target `build-win` now builds for Windows MSVC
- The makefile target `build-linux` now builds for GNU Linux and GNU Windows
- The makefile targets `install` and `install-dev` now install to Cargo's `bin` directory
- `install-dev` is now the default goal in the makefile
- `save_config.py` and `restore_config.py` have been updated to use pathlib so that paths are cross platform and no long *NIX paths
- Added handing for Ferinth's new error
- The integration tests also don't use hardcoded *NIX paths anymore
- `check_empty_config()` checks for curse_project now, this was a bug fixed by [SolidTux](https://github.com/SolidTux) in [PR #2](https://github.com/theRookieCoder/ferium/pull/2)
- Move Python scripts for testing to `tests/scripts/`

## [3.11.0] - 23.01.2022

### CURSEFORGE SUPPORT!

- Renamed `mod_ids` and `repos` to `modrinth_mods` and `github_repos` in `Profile`
- Added `curse_projects` to `Profile`
- Added `add-curseforge` command
- An API key is required to compile the application. Without this, the program will not compile. You can a provide blank value for this and the program will compile but anything using the CurseForge API will not work
- Upgrading mods now uses the downloaded file's actual filename rather than the mod name
- The remove command no long tries to remove the mod file (to be reintroduced later)
- Added 2 flags to the upgrade command
  - `no_picker` When upgrading GitHub mods, if multiple assets are compatible a picker is normally shown. This option disables this and uses the first one
  - `no_patch_check` Normally, upgrading curse and modrinth mods will check for the full game version, but sometimes mods works between patch versions, so this option skips checking for the patch version. This doesn't affect upgrading GitHub mods
- Made a test for the upgrade command. Will have to implement checking of the mods downloaded later
- Some integration tests have been edited to test curse mods too
- Upgrading GitHub mods now checks the releases' names for the game version too

## [3.10.1] - 17.01.2022
> Unreleased

- Upgrading Modrinth mods now correctly check the mod loader by converting the mod loader name to lowercase 

## [3.10.0] - 16.01.2022

HUGE UPDATE

### Project and Testing
- Upgraded to Clap 3.0
- Removed unit tests
- Added every single sub(sub)command to the integration tests
- The integration tests are now fully automatic because we can now pass options without the interactive UI

### Main
- Getting the config file no longer exits the program early when creating a new config file
- A more helpful error message for when decoding the config file fails
- The `profile create` subcommand now runs seperately before the current profile is read
- Multiple new command have been created such as `list_profiles()`, and `delete()`
- Many commands have been revamped to allow the arguments to be passed through the CLI rather than through a UI
- The `profile configure` command's UI now has an option to change the profile's name

### Arg Parsing
- Removed `cli.yaml` and switched from the deprecated yaml parsing to #[derive] based arg parsing
- Renamed `add`, `add-repo`, and `config` commands to `add-modrinth`, `add-github`, and `configure`
- The `create` and `config` commands are now under a new subcommand `profile`
- `profile delete` and `profile list` subsubcommands have been added
- The following commands have had options added to them so now using the interactive UI is optional. This also allows for fully automatic tests
  - Remove
  - Switch
  - Configure
  - Create
  - Delete

### Error handling
- There are now 2 errors for quitting
  - The `Quit` error stores its error message as a tuple `&'static str` so that raw strings can be used
  - The `QuitFormatted` error stores its error message as a tuple `String` so that `format!()` can be used for more informative error messages

### Configuration (`json.rs`)
- The `mod_loader` field in `Profile` is now an enum
- The `Profile::new()` is now `Profile::create_ui()`
- `create_ui()` now checks that the name provided does not already exist, if so it will ask for a new name
- Getting the path to the config file has been extracted to `get_config_file_path()`
- If `get_config_file()` does not find a config file, it now just creates an empty config, writes to it, and continues to return the config file

## [3.9.0] - 23.12.2021

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!

- The previous `Config` is now a `Profile`. The `Profile` has a new field, `name`
- The new `Config` contains a list of profiles and the index of the active profile
- Added a `create` command to create a new profile
- Added a `switch` command to switch between profiles
- A remove command for profiles will be added in the next update
- Switch back to Clap v2 because I'm rewriting the command system in the next update
- Edited makefile to run clippy in `make test` and builds
- Many code changes based on Clippy suggestions

## [3.8.1] - 29.11.2021

- Switched to `octocrab` and removed `octorok`
- Lots of code has been refactored and many comments and docs have been edited and improved
- The name of config file fields have been edited so that they more accurately represent the data they hold. **This breaks previous configs** and requires editing field names to fix
- In the config file, repos are now stored as tuples rather than structs
- Added verbose option to the list command. So now the non-verbose list command gives less information, but is faster
- Improved error handling
- Tweaked semver patch remove function so that it works on semvers other than Minecraft's
- Switched from `fancy-regex` to `onig`
- Added integration tests (**check the readme on how to properly run these**) and some unit tests too. These tests run before makefile builds

- Some other small improvements to `ferium config`	
- Tweaked `list()`'s output

## [3.6.0] - 30.10.2021

- Added a check for mod loader compatibility in `upgrade_modrinth()` and `upgrade_github()`
- Improved the GitHub Releases version and mod loader checking algorithm
- `download_release()` and `download_version()` are now `download_asset()` and `download_version_file()` repectively
- If multiple compatible assets were found, a selector is shown to let the user pick the latest version
- The progress indicators updates now show the name of the asset being downloaded rather than the name of the `Version` or `Release`

## [3.5.0] - 24.10.2021

### Added

- Build and release workflow
